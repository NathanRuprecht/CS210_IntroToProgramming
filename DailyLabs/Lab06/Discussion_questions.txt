Discussion question after 1f:
	What was the impact on the function when it had no parameters?
		I had to define all the variables inside the function.
	What was the impact on the function as additional parameters were added?
		The function just had the code that needed to be executed, none of the defining variables.
	What other possible parameters might be added to the drawSquare() function that would make the function more versatile?
		Define EVERYTHING outside the function so you had a minimum amount of stuff inside the function.
