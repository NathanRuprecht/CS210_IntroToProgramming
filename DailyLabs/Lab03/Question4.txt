x = int(input('Input: "))
y = 0
z = 0

while x > 0
	y = y + (x % 2) * 10 ** z
	z = z + 1
	x = x // 2
print(y)


Question 4 is set up so that the user inputs 'x', then the program will
continue to run as long as x // 2 is greater than 0.  While the program
loops through, the variables 'y' and 'z' are changing as well.  Once 
x // 2 is 0, the program exits the while loop and output the variable 'y'.



I did my 'pen and paper' on the board in class.
