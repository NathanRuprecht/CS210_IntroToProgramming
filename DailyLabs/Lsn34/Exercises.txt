Exercises:

1. Have the transmitter ask for the user's name when it first starts and
   then use that name to format messages as, "TFred says: Yabba dabba do!"

2. When a transmitter sends a message with a "B" prefix, it should shut down.

3. When a listener receives the message "shutdown", it should shut down.

4. When there are no more transmitters, the server should shut down all of the
   listeners and then shut itself down.
   a. This will require the server to keep track of each transmitter which in
      turn requires each transmitter use a unique name.
   b. The server will need to notify each listener with the "shutdown" message.
   c. Be sure to close all sockets on both ends!

5. Add a try/except in the server to gracefully deal with (i.e., not crash)
   the situation of a listener closing its connection. Ideally, remove the
   closed listener connection from the list of listeners as well.

Challenge Exercises:

1. What happens if a transmitter sends more than 1024 bytes?

2. What happens if a transmitter sends a character that cannot be encoded?
